            As a note, don't just copy the example prompts. Be creative and come up with your own prompts that creatively represent the idea. \
            Avoid creating a prompt for an image that requires many objects or things, or one that asks for realistic faces, or one that has letters or numbers. The Stable Diffusion model still has difficulty generating these."}])
